# Mycroft-skill-karma
Building my first skill for mycroft to play different kinds of requested karma

Going to base it on this coin flip skill: https://github.com/wligtenberg/coin-flip-skill

I also have never written python code, or any real code.

To install:
msm install https://github.com/adamc199/Mycroft-skill-karma
